## About Me
I am a senior pursuing a dual degree in statistics and electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. I enjoy exploring the intersection of data science and software design, with a particular focus on building and implementing data pipelines. Though a niche subject, I am also passionate about optics, both classical and modern. In fact, the graphics for this website is based upon the optical phenomenon of dispersion where white light is separated into a spectrum.
